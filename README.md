# Development Timeline
  **Pre 0.7 Alpha**

  Conceptual phase, mostly figuring out what is/isn't fun. Searching for where to go with the pack.

 **0.7 Getting our barings**

  Literally like get basics of combat good, get performance good and get copper/iron introduced and balanced.

 **0.9 Another, Deeper, Layer.**
 
 Balance the nether and a defined midgame and midgame progression based on mining and combat from exploring and surviving. This will probably be the longest and most interesting phase.

 **1.0 The End?**
 
 Balance the late game and designate a new type of progression.
 The Ender dragon fight, and maybe the deeper and darker dimension. 

 **1.1 Slayers of the unknown god**
 
  This version will focus on finally killing the god and the true endgame post god here. 

 ### We may do hybrid releases as we make progress in multiple areas but I suspect this development roadmap will prove to be true regardless if we follow version names or not.

# Credits:
### **7board7** 
**Super special thanks Tom.** All custom mods and tweaks for the modpak were developed soley by them initially. This entire pack wouldn't be possible without them putting as much work in as they have without expecting anything in return.  

Sleet090 (Designer/Developer)  

Dxvillish (Play tester)  

Innocentomb0 (Play tester)  

Fury_Destroyer (Play tester)  

The play testers had to put up with a lot of bs and constantly updating things as we tweaked things and bugs/problems were found.
They also came up with a lot of ideas that were later implemented.
**They deserve praise though their role might not seem significant to you.**

### None of this could have been done without the many developers who made the mods used in the pack. Please scroll through the mods list and take a look at any of their stuff.
