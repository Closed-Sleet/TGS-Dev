# TODO List
This is soley for the developers of the modpack to share ideas and act as a central todo list. Not for public use/viewing.
 ##  Fixes:
  - Work on Dynamic lighting
  - Remove random config options buttons for various mods litered around the menus using fancy menus mod
  - Cull mobs that are flagged as nightime only during day when out of sight from the player, this is to avoid mainly the undead horrors from harassing a player well into daytime.

   
 ## New stuff:
  **WHENEVER ADDING NEW DIMENSIONS ADD THEM TO THE TELEPORT BAN LIST FOR WEEPING ANGELS IN config/Weeping_angels-common.toml**
  - Make recipe for shield involve one soul steal instead of iron
  - Make the shield have a parry function, If timed correctly blocking should disable the attacker or deflect the projectile right back at the attacker (Maybe use a prediction of attackers movement to make it more likely to connect) Guarentee a crit on the follow up attack after the parry.
  - Nautilous shell armor modification
  - Make some sacrifice alter thing maybe use the existing sacrifices from the midnight madness mod (remember the freed spirit item from John Reborn)
  - Copper aromor/tools at chainmail/gold level respectively (maybe with custom effects?)
  - Add a death dimension
  - Custom Loading/title screens need to be made and implemented
  - Implement a written book given to the player that contains lore stuffs (outlined in the google docs attached below from TITLE PAGE to PAGE 5)

# Trailer idea:
 FOR TRAILER USE THE VANLLIA MINECRAFT Volume alpha:KEY music over B roll footage of vanilla landscapes and structures. 
 Random slices of complete silence with B roll of the environment darkened, with mobs/monsters.
 The stinger at the end should be completely Silent with the title and the eyes both fading in eyes getting closer.
