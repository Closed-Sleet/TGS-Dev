# TODO List
This is soley for the developers of the modpack to share ideas and act as a central todo list. Not for public use/viewing.
 ##  Fixes:
  - Work on Dynamic lighting
  - Remove random config options buttons for various mods litered around the menus using fancy menus mod
  - Cull mobs that are flagged as nightime only during day when out of sight from the player, this is to avoid mainly the undead horrors from harassing a player well into daytime.

   
 ## New stuff:
  **WHENEVER ADDING NEW DIMENSIONS ADD THEM TO THE TELEPORT BAN LIST FOR WEEPING ANGELS IN config/Weeping_angels-common.toml**
  - Nautilous shell armor modification
  - Make some sacrifice alter thing maybe use the existing sacrifices from the midnight madness mod (remember the freed spirit item from John Reborn)
  - Copper aromor/tools at chainmail/gold level respectively (maybe with custom effects?)
  - Add a death dimension
  - Custom Loading/title screens need to be made and implemented
  - Implement a written book given to the player that contains lore stuffs (outlined in the google docs attached below from TITLE PAGE to PAGE 5)

# Trailer idea:
 FOR TRAILER USE THE VANLLIA MINECRAFT Volume alpha:KEY music over B roll footage of vanilla landscapes and structures. 
 Random slices of complete silence with B roll of the environment darkened, with mobs/monsters.
 The stinger at the end should be completely Silent with the title and the eyes both fading in eyes getting closer.

# LORE MOMENT
The following is the text for the book idea:

The Silent World,
Currently the home of an unknown but violent god. Do not under any circumstances travel to this world. The god seems to only be growing in power the more travelers lost. The god seems to be somehow preventing travelers from leaving.
DO NOT ENGAGE.

Page 2:
That’s what the official warning stated anyways. Upon further research it became apparent just how dangerous this world, and by extension this god, must be. Thousands of travelers missing over the years. I know I might die, but I have to do something.

Page 3:
Day 1,
Quickly noting some observations. This world seems friendly if not barren. Maybe the god left this land long ago and nobody has realized. Need to find a way back though, my magic doesn’t seem to work at all in this world.

Page 4:
The great silence that was described seems to have ended. I don’t know why or how a god would silence a world. I don’t even know how the authorities got that information so it could be wrong. Though some things do line up and all that information was dated by centuries.

Page 5:
Regardless, first I need to make a shelter from the elements and any beasts that may be nocturnal. Don’t want to waste time before I have my bearings and a setup. I’ll learn some of the laws of this world in the process too.
