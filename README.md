# TODO List
### Project is still in active development, as such this github is for the conveince of the devs and public if they want to observe progress or otherwise interested in the project.

 ##  Fixes:
  - Work on Dynamic lighting
  - Remove random config options buttons for various mods litered around the menus using fancy menus mod
  - Cull mobs that are flagged as nightime only during day when out of sight from the player, this is to avoid mainly the undead horrors from harassing a player well into daytime.

   
 ## New stuff:
  **WHENEVER ADDING NEW DIMENSIONS ADD THEM TO THE TELEPORT BAN LIST FOR WEEPING ANGELS IN config/Weeping_angels-common.toml**
  - Make recipe for shield involve one soul steal instead of iron
  - Make the shield have a parry function, If timed correctly blocking should disable the attacker or deflect the projectile right back at the attacker. Guarentee a crit on the follow up attack after the parry.
  - Nautilous shell armor modifications?
  - Make some sacrifice alter thing maybe use the existing sacrifices from the midnight madness mod (remember the freed spirit item from John Reborn)
  - Copper aromor/tools at chainmail/gold level respectively (maybe with custom effects?)
  - Add a death dimension
  - Custom Loading/title screens need to be made and implemented
  - Implement a written book given to the player that contains lore stuffs (outlined in the google docs attached below from TITLE PAGE to PAGE 5)

# LORE MOMENT
Lore overview for dev eyes only, no peeking :)

# Trailer idea:
 FOR TRAILER USE THE VANLLIA MINECRAFT Volume alpha:KEY music over B roll footage of vanilla landscapes and structures. 
 Random slices of complete silence with B roll of the environment darkened, with mobs/monsters.
 The stinger at the end should be completely Silent with the title and the eyes both fading in eyes getting closer.

# Credits:
### **Tommie** 
**Super special thanks.** All custom mods and tweaks for the modpak were developed soley by him. This entire pack wouldn't be possible without him putting as much work in as he has without expecting anything in return.  

Sleet090 (Designer behind the mod pack)  

Dxvillish (Play tester)  

Innocentomb0 (Play tester)  

Fury_Destroyer (Play tester)  

The play testers had to put up with a lot of bs and constantly updating things as we tweaked things and bugs/problems were found.
They also came up with a lot of ideas that were later implemented.
**They deserve praise though their role might not seem significant to you.**

### None of this could have been done without the many developers who made and open sourced all the mods used in the pack. Please scroll through the mods list and take a look at any of their stuff.
