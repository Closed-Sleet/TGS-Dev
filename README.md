# Trailer idea:
FOR TRAILER USE THE VANLLIA MINECRAFT Volume alpha:KEY music over B roll footage of vanilla landscapes and structures. 
Random slices of complete silence with B roll of the environment darkened, with mobs/monsters.
The stinger at the end should be completely Silent with the title and the eyes both fading in eyes getting closer.
