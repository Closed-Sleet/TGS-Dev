# Development Timeline
 ## 1.0 will be early game from spawning into obtaining copper/iron tools and armor. 
  (We've already done a lot here hence we are on version 0.84rn)

 ## 2.0 Will be from copper/iron all the way to the nether 
  (Already some mild work here but still lot of thought needed)

 ## 3.0 Will focus on the end. 
  The Ender dragon fight, and the deeper and darker dimension. 
  (Like 1 or 2 steps taken down this path)

 ## 4.0 The Wither, Layer of the unknown god. 
  This version will focus on finally killing the god and the true endgame post dragon here. 
  (Entirely conceptual and barely even considered yet)

 ### We may do hybrid releases as we make progress in multiple areas but I suspect this development roadmap will prove to be true regardless if we follow it or not.

# Possible Combat changes
We need to add more to minecrafts combat that much is obvious. I put a lot of thought into his and we should add magic damage in as an actual thing other than potions. Yes we can have the esoteric magic damage things both ranged and melee. I also think we should distinguish the magic damage from the physical damage while having hybrid variants with both. Balancing for this can be scaled to different defense types. We can also discern different physical and magic damage types. Such as bludgeoning, slicing, and stabbing for physical. With Magic you'd have either Empowered or Draining with subtypes of each. Empowering would work similarly to bludgeoning and slicing with different subtypes. Draining would be similar but different. Empowered would be like fire, telekinesis (Force), electricity, Water stuff, anything that's using magic to empower the environment against the thing. Whereas Draining would be directly affecting the entity/monster, that being any Freezing/ice (draining heat), Psychic abilities, soul manipulations, etc. Anything that directly manipulates the thing, So partially telekinesis if it's used on the thing in question as opposed to providing force from the environment. Copper can be a great introduction to this. Copper equipment could be focused on magic damage and defense, meanwhile iron would focus on the physical. Adding a hybrid with Soul steal being an alloy made by smelting iron with essence, maybe we make copper part of the recipe for that soul steal alloy being the hybrid physical and magic. Then gold and diamonds could be the next level, then finally netherite and redstone. Maybe further based on the modded stuff we haven't really experienced yet. 

This creates a multifaceted combat system with specializations and potentially the back bone for what minecraft combat really should have been. The low durability of the magic based armors and tools would make sense if we make the Mana pool, however we implement one, act as your magic resistance or durability. To use magic you'd first have to unlock it, maybe using copper to craft something edible that then increases your max mana from 0 - Whatever's fair for early game. From then on all permanent buffs to base come as one time use edible items crafted at each respective tier. That makes the mana pool scale slightly for everybody,
whether or not they are using magic armors and also allows for balancing mana pools based on armor sets or individual pieces.  For the final level of magic/physical armor it should be an alloy of every preceding material + a nether star. This used at an upgrade station on any previous level will give you varied armor that goes into the specific damage types instead of just broadly. Maybe set bonuses for augmenting specific subtypes like bludgeon or electricity based on the material. 

Then each mob and monster is assigned custom defense values to the broad magic and physical with armor protecting from specifics. That way zombies and skeletons early game are less tanky but can maintain that power as the player progresses while the monsters get easier to handle 1 on 1. The later game should challenge the players' combat and building combined. The end fight could easily do this.  With blocking being used to strategically manipulate the landscape to avoid being harassed too much by the monsters, which should all be on overtime aggressiveness during the fight. Then post ender dragon the focus will turn to exploring the end. We should make the world more challenging after this, monsters should have their stalking phase disabled. Instead outright attacking the player whenever they spawn. Maybe make/add monsters that specifically spawn post ender dragon and augment the behavior of all of them.

The ender dragon won't be the final boss. The wither will be.  I want the wither to be special so let's come up with some ideas to make the wither fight more interesting based on the fight as it is vanilla. Also the wither is the best fit for the "unknown god" honestly. It's almost too perfect. We could also use Herobrine but that seems too on the nose honestly. Besides, he's not really unknown. The wither would be a complete surprise to most I believe. As the wither is so often overlooked.



## Mob specific ideas:
 Witches should probably be given an overhaul, let's make them true magic users.
 No more potion lobing for them. Also no more healing pots, only healing magic baby.
 Specific magic types determined on spawn of the witch and witch will have primary abilities it will use against the player.
 Maybe give some monsters these abilities, like Herobrine for example. He mostly does nothing so giving him a purpose in this regard would be amazing and fitting considering.
